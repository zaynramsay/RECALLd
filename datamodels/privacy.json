            "content": "RECALLd is strategically designed with an paramount commitment to user privacy. The Application employs a rigorous data minimization approach, categorically affirming that no personal identifiable information (PII) is collected, stored, or processed. The sole mechanism of data interaction is through the retrieval of publicly available recall information via the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) publicly accessible Application Programming Interface (API)."

API requests are strictly limited to the minimal information necessary for functional execution. No user-specific, personally attributable data is transmitted during these interactions. Each API request is designed to protect user anonymity and maintain the highest standards of data privacy."

            1. Collect notification-related metadata
